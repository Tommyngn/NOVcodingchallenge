\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my solution, I chose the solution that resulted in the shortest amount of time possible. At first I wanted to group each customer with their Teller\'92s specialtype. Which did not seem efficient because there were customers with different type numbers. i then moved on to designing an algorithm that would take over the appointment with the least amount of duration time. it reduced the time by a good amount but still too high to be realistic and efficient. In the end, I went with the solution where I would assigned each teller a customer randomly and the solution resulted in a drastic time reduction.}
